Quick field note: Simplify STIG compliance checks with the new Database Security Assessment Tool (DBSAT) version 4.0. I’ve watched multiple teams wrestle with this, and it usually starts the same way: big goals, some quick wins, then creeping complexity. The early excitement fades when small misalignments—like unclear ownership or half-finished configs—turn into recurring headaches. Fixing simplify stig and stig compliance early is rarely flashy, but it’s the difference between firefighting every week and sleeping well at night.

My take: Simple, observable paths beat clever, fragile ones. The fastest way to improve outcomes is to make success measurable and boring to repeat. That means clear definitions of done, tested recovery steps, and visibility into the right signals—not just raw metrics. Treat compliance checks and checks new as design inputs from day one, not problems to patch later. When the fundamentals are right, the advanced tuning actually sticks.

• Define stig compliance and make someone accountable.
• Automate database security and make someone accountable.
• Baseline checks new and make someone accountable.
