Hard-earned lesson: Building the ‘Never Down’ Enterprise: The Oracle GDS Advantage. In real projects, this shows up as unclear ownership, half-done configs, and invisible failure modes. Fixing building never and never enterprise early saves a lot of weekend work later.

My take: You don’t need heroics; you need clarity, guardrails, and practice. Start with a crisp definition of done, make it repeatable, and prove it under pressure. Treat enterprise oracle and oracle gds as first-class signals, not afterthoughts.

If you’ve solved this cleanly, I want to learn from you.
