From recent work: Announcing OCI Landing Zones AI Transaction Monitoring Workload Template. I’ve watched multiple teams wrestle with this, and it usually starts the same way: big goals, some quick wins, then creeping complexity. The early excitement fades when small misalignments—like unclear ownership or half-finished configs—turn into recurring headaches. Fixing announcing oci and oci landing early is rarely flashy, but it’s the difference between firefighting every week and sleeping well at night.

My take: Simple, observable paths beat clever, fragile ones. The fastest way to improve outcomes is to make success measurable and boring to repeat. That means clear definitions of done, tested recovery steps, and visibility into the right signals—not just raw metrics. Treat landing zones and zones transaction as design inputs from day one, not problems to patch later. When the fundamentals are right, the advanced tuning actually sticks.

• Define landing zones and make someone accountable.
• Automate oci landing and make someone accountable.
• Baseline zones transaction and make someone accountable.

If you’ve solved this cleanly, I’d love to hear how.
