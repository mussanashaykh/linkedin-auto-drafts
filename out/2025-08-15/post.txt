Field note: Improve AWS DMS continuous replication performance by using column filters to parallelize high-volume tables

In this post, we explore how you can use column filters to divide a high-activity table into multiple tasks during the CDC phase

• Keep configs repeatable (IaC) and versioned.
• Prefer SSL/TLS everywhere; verify wallet/keystore early.
• Separate initial load (DMS) from CDC (GoldenGate) for sanity.
• Automate logs & metrics; test DR like you mean it.
