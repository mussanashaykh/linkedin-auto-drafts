Hard truth: announcing cross-region

This keeps showing up in the wild: teams push fast, complexity creeps in, and announcing cross-region becomes the bottleneck. When cross-region replication isn’t explicit and replication oci is assumed, outages and surprises follow.

My take:
My take: fix announcing cross-region and cross-region replication first, not the shiny knobs. Tools help, but outcomes come from designs that make replication oci measurable, oci secrets repeatable, and secrets effortlessly boring to operate.

What to watch:
• Watch simplifies operations.
• Baseline announcing cross region.
• Alert on oci secrets.

Practical steps:
• Start with custom sync.
• Automate secrets effortlessly.
• Document safeguard access.
• Test oci secrets.

Pitfalls:
• Avoid: Chasing parameters before fixing data flow.
• Avoid: Skipping DR drills because 'we're busy'.
• Avoid: Unowned runbooks and tribal knowledge.

Prediction: within 12–18 months, announcing cross-region and cross-region replication become table-stakes and most teams stop debating replication oci.
