If you’re in the middle of this: Implement multi-Region endpoint routing for Amazon Aurora DSQL. I’ve watched multiple teams wrestle with this, and it usually starts the same way: big goals, some quick wins, then creeping complexity. The early excitement fades when small misalignments—like unclear ownership or half-finished configs—turn into recurring headaches. Fixing implement multi region and multi region endpoint early is rarely flashy, but it’s the difference between firefighting every week and sleeping well at night.

My take: The wins come from getting the basics right and repeating them. The fastest way to improve outcomes is to make success measurable and boring to repeat. That means clear definitions of done, tested recovery steps, and visibility into the right signals—not just raw metrics. Treat endpoint routing and routing amazon as design inputs from day one, not problems to patch later. When the fundamentals are right, the advanced tuning actually sticks.
