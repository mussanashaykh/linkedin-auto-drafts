From recent work: OkHttpClient Client not sending server-name extension in SSL Client handshake. I’ve watched multiple teams wrestle with this, and it usually starts the same way: big goals, some quick wins, then creeping complexity. The early excitement fades when small misalignments—like unclear ownership or half-finished configs—turn into recurring headaches. Fixing okhttpclient client and client sending early is rarely flashy, but it’s the difference between firefighting every week and sleeping well at night.

My take: You don’t need heroics; you need clarity, guardrails, and practice. The fastest way to improve outcomes is to make success measurable and boring to repeat. That means clear definitions of done, tested recovery steps, and visibility into the right signals—not just raw metrics. Treat sending server name and server name extension as design inputs from day one, not problems to patch later. When the fundamentals are right, the advanced tuning actually sticks.

• Define ssl client and make someone accountable.
• Automate okhttpclient client and make someone accountable.
• Baseline client sending and make someone accountable.

If you’ve solved this cleanly, I’d love to hear how.
