From recent work: How do I implement ToString for my custom primitive type that does not need a Formatter without going against Rust's guidelines?. I’ve watched multiple teams wrestle with this, and it usually starts the same way: big goals, some quick wins, then creeping complexity. The early excitement fades when small misalignments—like unclear ownership or half-finished configs—turn into recurring headaches. Fixing implement tostring and tostring custom early is rarely flashy, but it’s the difference between firefighting every week and sleeping well at night.

My take: Most pain isn’t exotic—it’s small gaps that add up under load. The fastest way to improve outcomes is to make success measurable and boring to repeat. That means clear definitions of done, tested recovery steps, and visibility into the right signals—not just raw metrics. Treat custom primitive and primitive type as design inputs from day one, not problems to patch later. When the fundamentals are right, the advanced tuning actually sticks.

What’s been your experience with this?
