Hard-earned lesson: The One Trick to 10x Your Database Performance [video]. I’ve watched multiple teams wrestle with this, and it usually starts the same way: big goals, some quick wins, then creeping complexity. The early excitement fades when small misalignments—like unclear ownership or half-finished configs—turn into recurring headaches. Fixing one trick and trick 10x early is rarely flashy, but it’s the difference between firefighting every week and sleeping well at night.

My take: The wins come from getting the basics right and repeating them. The fastest way to improve outcomes is to make success measurable and boring to repeat. That means clear definitions of done, tested recovery steps, and visibility into the right signals—not just raw metrics. Treat 10x database and database performance as design inputs from day one, not problems to patch later. When the fundamentals are right, the advanced tuning actually sticks.

• Define trick 10x and make someone accountable.
• Automate 10x database and make someone accountable.
• Baseline one trick and make someone accountable.

If you’ve solved this cleanly, I’d love to hear how.
