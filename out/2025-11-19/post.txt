Hard-earned lesson: Introducing the New Fleet Application Management Release. I’ve watched multiple teams wrestle with this, and it usually starts the same way: big goals, some quick wins, then creeping complexity. The early excitement fades when small misalignments—like unclear ownership or half-finished configs—turn into recurring headaches. Fixing introducing new and new fleet early is rarely flashy, but it’s the difference between firefighting every week and sleeping well at night.

My take: You don’t need heroics; you need clarity, guardrails, and practice. The fastest way to improve outcomes is to make success measurable and boring to repeat. That means clear definitions of done, tested recovery steps, and visibility into the right signals—not just raw metrics. Treat fleet application and application management as design inputs from day one, not problems to patch later. When the fundamentals are right, the advanced tuning actually sticks.

• Define introducing new and make someone accountable.
• Automate release excited and make someone accountable.
• Baseline application management and make someone accountable.
